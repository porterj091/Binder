# Binder

This is a program binder where it will pack any number of executables into one package to be run once.  

## How to operate
1. Run the python driver script  
  ```python binder.py [ARGS]```  
  The ARGS are the locations of the programs you want to bind together.  
2. Run the executables  
  ```./bound```
